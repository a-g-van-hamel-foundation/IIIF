To organise individual IIIF resources into collections, you can create what is called a 'IIIF Collection' that references other manifests or even other collections. It is supported in many IIIF viewers such as Mirador to help users navigate and discover other digital media out there. The `iiif-collection` API module lets you create such a collection from the result of a Semantic MediaWiki query and returns an appropriate JSON output according to the [Presentation API v3](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#51-collection). This guide explains what semantic data structure is expected and how you can set up configurations to create your own collections.

## How it works

### Data structure
- It is assumed that for every manifest URL to appear in the collection, a [subobject](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Adding_subobjects) is used to record it. 
- It is assumed that such a subobject belongs to a wiki page about an object, such as a particular painting or manuscript.
- In addition to using a property to record the manifest URL (registered as `IIIFCollectionItemURI` below), the subobject must also use a property to link back to its 'parent', the page (registered as `IIIFCollectionItemResource` below).
- P.S. One reason for preferring subobjects to a more direct use of multi-valued properties is that it lends itself better to potentially multiple URLs for the same subject.

### Configuration
Given this outline of the data structure, you need to add the required properties and query conditions to a configuration. As we saw earlier, you can add a configuration on two levels:

1. Globally, in your local settings. Conceivably, this would be used to enable a comprehensive collection of all manifests that are recorded in your wiki. To use this configuration, the API module, `/api.php?action=iiif-collection&format=2&formatversion=2` or its redirect `/Special:IIIFServ/collection`, can be used without additional parameters.
2. Individually, on a wiki page. You can create as many collections as you want by creating, for each collection, a configuration page in the IIIF namespace. To use any configuration page with the API module, its page ID must be set in the `smwconfig` parameter of the URL string (`/api.php?action=iiif-collection&format=2&formatversion=2&smwconfig=<pageid>`). 

| Local settings  | JSON `"config"` > | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  `$wgIIIFCollectionQueryArg` | `"IIIFCollectionQueryArg"` > `"value"` | condition to query for every subobject that uses the property specified in `IIIFCollectionItemURI` |
| `$wgIIIFCollectionItemURI` | `"IIIFCollectionItemURI"` > `"value"` | the property used to record a manifest URL |
| `$wgIIIFCollectionItemResource` | `"IIIFCollectionItemResource"` > `"value"` | the property used to link back from the subobject to the wiki page |
| `$wgIIIFCollectionSortProp` | `"IIIFCollectionSortProp"` > `"value"` | property used to sort items of the collection. Use commas to separate multiple properties. |
| (Generated) | `"IIIFCollectionLabel"` > `"value"` | Label for the collection |
| - | `"IIIFCollectionSummary"` > `"value"` | Short summary of the collection |

### Example
If the above still sounds a little abstract, it should be easier to understand by way of an illustration. Suppose we have wiki pages about paintings and we can query them as a group because they all use a property `Class` with a value 'Painting'. In simplified form, the semantics of an article about a painting by Glindoni (1850â€“1913) may look like this:

```
{{#set:
|Class=Painting
|Has title=John Dee performing an experiment before Queen Elizabeth I
|Artist=Glindoni, Henry Gillard
}}
{{#subobject:
|Class=IIIF Manifest
|Link has URL=https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0033-choice/manifest.json
|For page={{FULLPAGENAME}}
}}
```

To enable a query that collects all manifest URLs for digitised paintings, settings 

- `$wgIIIFCollectionQueryArg` = `"[[Class::IIIF Manifest]] [[For page.Class::Painting]]"` (query condition)
- `$wgIIIFCollectionItemURI` = `"Link has URL"` (property with a value for the manifest URL)
- `$wgIIIFCollectionItemResource` = `"For page"` (links subobject to page)
- `$wgIIIFCollectionSortProp` = `"For page.Has title"` (sort by title)

```
{
	"config": {
		"IIIFCollectionLabel": {
			"value": "Paintings"
		},
		"IIIFCollectionDescriptipn": {
			"value": "A wonderful collection of digitised paintings."
		},
		"IIIFCollectionQueryArg": {
			"value": "[[Class::IIIF Manifest]] [[For page.Class::Painting]]"
		},
		"IIIFCollectionItemURI": {
			"value": "Link has URL"
		},
		"IIIFCollectionItemResource": {
			"value": "For page",
			"description": "Links subobject to page"
		},
		"IIIFCollectionSortProp": {
			"value": "For page.Has title",
			"description": "Sort by page title"
		}
	}
}
```
