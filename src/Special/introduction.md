The IIIF extension is an extension to MediaWiki which offers a set of API services and associated tools for working with [IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)](https://iiif.io/). IIIF, commonly pronounced as ‘triple eye eff’, refers to a set of open standards for serving different types of digital resources, notably images, on the web. These standards help developers build complementary and interoperable software tools to improve how users can access, explore, interact with and share digital media.
